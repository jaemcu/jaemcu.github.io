### Advanced Usage

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

#### Gulp Tasks

- `gulp` the default task that builds everything
- `gulp watch` browserSync opens the project in your default browser and live reloads when changes are made
- `gulp css` compiles SCSS files into CSS and minifies the compiled CSS
- `gulp js` minifies the themes JS file
- `gulp vendor` copies dependencies from node_modules to the vendor directory

You must have npm and Gulp installed globally in order to use these features.

# Portfolio


## Objectives


## Installation


## Purpose

What do you want people to find when they google you?
What do you want someone's first impression of you to be?
Your portfolio is the portal to your professional online presence.
It consolidates the content you've created on multiple platforms and presents
it in digest form, making it easier for future employers to learn more about you.

## User Stories to Get Started

- As a non-technical HR manager, I want to quickly evaluate whether this candidate has the skills and experience to fill an open position at my company.
- As a mid-level engineer, I want to evaluate a junior developer’s coding skills by reviewing their projects and reading their code.
- As a friend of the person who built this portfolio, I want to understand what they do as a developer and what they have created.

## Required Sections

- About Me: Short blurb explaining who you are, and some background info
- Skills: All the skills you have that may be helpful on the job
- Contact info: LinkedIn, Github, city, email or contact form
- Resume: View and download
- Project Showcase: Feature your GA projects (more details below)

### Optional Sections

- Personal hobbies/interests
- Professional Timeline (a visual representation of your work history)
- Additional work samples (visual design, writing samples, a link to your photography blog)
- Relevant social profiles (Twitter, Instagram, if they highlight you professionally, not just what your meals look like)
- Blog posts (links to relevant articles you've published on platforms like Medium or LinkedIn)

## Highlighting Your Projects

Your projects should be featured prominently on your portfolio.  You'll want future employers to see what you accomplished both while you were at GA and after completing this program.

- **List projects in reverse chronological order.**  Your capstone is likely the project that best showcases your skills.  Make sure it's featured prominently as the first project in your portfolio.
- For your team project, be sure to fork, clone, and individually redeploy your project to maintain individual ownership over the site showcased on your portfolio.
- Include links to your live site as well as front-end and back-end repos.
- Summarize the functionality of the app as well as what technologies you used to build it.
- Briefly describe your process for building each app. If you have a blog post that goes into detail for each project, link to that post.
- Make sure your projects are user-friendly to an unacquainted visitor.
  - The home page should explain the site’s functionality
  - **Random users might not want to sign up/sign in.** Consider adding dummy credentials on the homepage that they can use (and explain that), or make sure they can interact with the site without signing up.
- After you've completed the program, **revisit your projects and refactor them**.  Add new features.  Improve the user experience.  Fix any open issues.  Enhance the app's design aesthetic.
- **Clean up test data** and create some seed data that you can use to easily refresh your database.  If you want to get fancy, you can write a [scheduled task](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler) that drops, recreates, and reseeds your database periodically.

### Design Hints for the Non-designer

- **Choose a template as the basis for your portfolio and customize it.**

- **Start with a framework.**


### Github “User Site” vs. “Project Sites”

Github provides only ***one*** “User Site” per account/organization with the url `username.github.io`. Your user site should be used for your portfolio since it will showcase the rest of your projects on Github. The user site is unique in that it is served from the `master` branch of your repository. Read more about [User Sites here](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#project-pages).

Other web apps/sites you host on Github are known as “Project Sites”. These will have URLs in the form of `username.github.io/project_names` and are served from the `gh-pages` branch of your repository. You can have an unlimited number of project sites.  At the conclusion of this program, you'll have at least four —  one for each of your projects — but we hope you develop many more!  Read more about [Project Sites here](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#user--organization-pages).
